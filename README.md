This is a college project, about a the unfuniest game ever created in humanity history

Yes you read well, this game is 100% unfun. The rules are this:

1- The objective is to clear the board by selecting numbers that match or that add to ten. Numbers match vertically or horizontally and must be contiguous.

2- A numbers are considered contiguous if they have an empty space between them (were there was previously a number) or if they are next each other. The horizontallity also applies if the numbers are in different lines as long as there is nothing between them horizontally

Controls:
- WASD/arrows: Move cursor

- X/spacebar: Mark number

- G: Generate new numbers

- Q: Exit and save progress

- P: Clue (not implemented)
